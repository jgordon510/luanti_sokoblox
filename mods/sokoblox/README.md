# Sokoblox Luanti
## created for the 2024 Luanti Game Jam
### a rolling/push block puzzle game

This game is a sequel to Sokoblox for Pico-8.  

Besides being in 3d, this game also adds a mechanic of color matching.  Each block now has a different color on each of its six sides.

In order to complete a target, you must not only cover the target, but cover it with a block that has the same color on top.
